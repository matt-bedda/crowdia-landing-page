## **12\. User Discovery & Validation**

Per validare le ipotesi iniziali e costruire personas basate su dati reali, è stata condotta una fase di **user discovery**.

### **Metodologia**

* **Interviste esplorative:** 10–15 utenti tra 18 e 35 anni, residenti in aree urbane (Palermo, Catania, Milano, Bologna).

* **Sondaggi brevi:** diffusi online e in community universitarie e locali.

* La paura di “perdersi qualcosa” (FOMO) è un **motore decisionale potente**.

### **Validazioni per il Progetto**

* L’idea di **mappe social** con attività dal vivo è risultata intuitiva e molto apprezzata.
