# **Legal & Financial Framework** 

# **(Innovative Startup ‚Äì Italy 2025\)**

üéØ **Goal:** Build a platform that allows users to purchase tickets and interact through a native token, while maintaining full **legal compliance**, **tax efficiency**, and **zero unnecessary licensing requirements**.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Company Structure**

* Incorporate **CROWDIA S.R.L. Innovativa** (Innovative Startup):

  * Minimal capital, flexible bylaws, investor credibility.

  * Access to **fiscal benefits, simplified accounting, and innovation incentives**.

* Recommended ATECO codes:

  * `63.12.00 ‚Äì Web portals`

  * or `79.90.19 ‚Äì Event booking and intermediation services`.

* No SIAE, Consob, or Bank of Italy license required.

üëâ All you need is a **registered company with a VAT number**, no additional authorization.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Service Legal Model**

CROWDIA acts as a **platform for event discovery and intermediation**, **not the event organizer**.

* **Users** buy tickets exclusively using **CROWDIA Tokens**.

* **Organizers** receive tokens as payment and can convert them to euros via MoonPay.

* CROWDIA manages **the platform, community, and transaction fees**, but **never holds or transfers fiat money**.

üëâ CROWDIA does **not issue fiscal tickets**, only *digital access passes* or *event vouchers*.  
 Organizers remain **fully responsible** for tax compliance and event liability.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Payment & Token System**

### **üîπ Operational Flow**

1. Users **purchase tokens through MoonPay** (fiat ‚Üí token).

2. Tokens are **used inside the app** to buy tickets, rewards, or services.

3. Organizers receive tokens and can:

   * keep them in-app, or

   * **convert them into euros** via MoonPay.

### **üîπ Legal Framework**

* The CROWDIA Token is a **utility token** ‚Äî not a currency or financial instrument.

* All **fiat conversions** are handled exclusively by **MoonPay**, a **regulated VASP**.

* CROWDIA **never handles fiat**, **never executes KYC/AML**, and **does not operate wallets directly**.

* The in-app wallet is **non-custodial (visual)**: CROWDIA shows balances, but real custody/conversion happens at MoonPay.

üëâ This setup means **no financial or crypto license is needed**.  
 CROWDIA remains a **digital platform**, while MoonPay ensures full financial compliance.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance & Liability**

| Area | Legal Requirement | CROWDIA‚Äôs Compliance |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **GDPR / Privacy** | Explicit consent for user data | Clear Privacy Policy \+ minimal data handling |
| **Event Liability** | Organizer is legally responsible | Legal disclaimer in Terms of Use |
| **UGC (User Content)** | User responsibility | Moderation \+ user liability clause |
| **KYC / AML** | Required for fiat conversions only | Fully delegated to MoonPay |

üëâ In short: **CROWDIA is a tech and marketing platform**, not a financial operator or event organizer.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Taxation (Italy)**

CROWDIA pays taxes **only on its actual revenues**, meaning:

* **transaction fees** retained per ticket sale,

* **subscriptions / premium services**,

* **sponsorships or partnerships**.

All token transactions between users and organizers are **non-taxable**, because:

* CROWDIA **does not handle real money**,

* unconverted tokens are considered **internal digital credits**, not income.

### **üí∞ Tax Overview:**

| Tax Type | Rate | Applies To |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **IRES** (Corporate Income Tax) | 24% | On net profits (revenues \- expenses) |
| **IRAP** (Regional Tax) | \~3.9% | On regional taxable base |
| **VAT (IVA)** | 22% | On billed services and fees |
| **INPS (Social Security)** | variable | Only for active shareholders/managers |

üí° As an **Innovative Startup**, CROWDIA benefits from:

* **Partial IRAP exemption**,

* **Reduced INPS contributions**,

* **Investor tax deductions**,

* **Simplified bureaucracy and accounting**.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Real Example (How Taxes Work)**

1. A user buys ‚Ç¨100 worth of tokens via MoonPay ‚Üí CROWDIA **receives nothing**.

2. The user spends 20 tokens for a ticket ‚Üí CROWDIA keeps a 10% fee (2 tokens).

3. MoonPay converts 2 tokens into euros ‚Üí transfers ‚Ç¨2 to CROWDIA‚Äôs bank account.  
    üëâ CROWDIA **pays VAT and IRES only on those ‚Ç¨2**, not on the entire transaction.
