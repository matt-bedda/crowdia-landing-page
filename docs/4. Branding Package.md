# 3\. Official Color Palette

CROWDIA’s visual identity is built around a minimal, high-impact color system designed for clarity, recognition, and digital versatility.  
 The core palette consists of **Magenta (\#FF007F)**, symbolizing creativity, energy, and social connection; **Charcoal (\#2E2E2E)**, representing stability, contrast, and modern sophistication; and **White (\#FFFFFF)**, which brings balance, space, and lightness to the overall design.  
 This triad ensures a consistent, contemporary aesthetic that feels both vibrant and professional across all touchpoints — from the app interface to marketing communications.

# 4\. Typography Rules & Usage

CROWDIA’s typographic system balances **distinctiveness and readability**, ensuring a unified voice across all platforms.  
 The brand uses two complementary typefaces:

* **Primary Font:** *Montserrat Bold* — used for the logo, main titles, and key statements. Its geometric and tech-inspired design gives CROWDIA a strong, recognizable character that reflects innovation and digital culture.

* **Secondary Font:** *Inter* — used for all interface text, paragraphs, and supporting content. It offers excellent legibility across digital and mobile environments.

**Usage Guidelines:**

* Use *Montserrat Bold* only for headlines, logos, and short impactful text. Avoid using it in long paragraphs.

* Use *Inter Regular* or *Inter Medium* for body text, ensuring clarity and a clean hierarchy.

* Maintain sufficient line spacing (130–150%) and use sentence case for approachability.

* Avoid combining additional font families to keep the brand consistent and minimalist.

# **5\. Graphic Style & Visual System**

CROWDIA’s graphic style is **minimal, modern, and digital-first**, reflecting its identity as a social-tech platform.  
 The design language focuses on **clean geometry, strong contrast**, and the dynamic use of magenta to capture attention without clutter.

**Key Visual Principles:**

* Use **flat design** with simple shapes and balanced white space. Avoid excessive shadows or effects.

* Integrate **network or circuit-inspired lines** subtly in backgrounds or patterns to evoke connection and flow.

* Apply **gradients** (Magenta → White or Magenta → Charcoal) sparingly for depth in headers or hero visuals.

* Keep compositions **centered and structured**, ensuring readability and balance.

* Photography and imagery should feel **urban, human, and energetic**, often with soft magenta overlays to unify the tone.

This visual system ensures every CROWDIA asset — from UI to social media — feels part of one cohesive ecosystem: **bold, smart, and real.**

### **6\. Social Media Templates & Visual Communication**

CROWDIA’s social presence must reflect the same energy and clarity as the app itself.  
 Visual communication on social platforms should be **bold, simple, and instantly recognizable**, leveraging the magenta brand color as a key signature across all formats.

**Guidelines:**

* **Formats:** Use platform-native ratios (Instagram posts 1:1, Stories 9:16, X banners 3:1, TikTok covers 9:16).

* **Layout:** Keep clean margins and centered compositions. Highlight one key message or image per post.

* **Colors:** Use **Magenta (\#FF007F)** as the primary background or accent, with Charcoal or White for text contrast.

* **Typography:** *Montserrat Bold* for titles and headlines, *Inter* for captions or body text.

* **Tone:** Energetic, positive, and community-driven — focus on real-life moments, events, and interactions rather than generic graphics.

* **Imagery:** Use authentic, urban photography featuring people and connections; avoid overused stock visuals.

### **7\. UI Mockups & App Interface Guidelines**

CROWDIA’s interface design reflects its identity: **clean, intuitive, and energetic**.  
 The visual language of the app should enhance usability while reinforcing brand recognition through consistent use of color, typography, and spacing.

**Core UI Principles:**

* **Color Use:** Magenta (\#FF007F) is the main action color for buttons, highlights, and key interactive elements. Charcoal (\#2E2E2E) is used for text and dark backgrounds, while White (\#FFFFFF) provides clarity and contrast.

* **Buttons & States:** Use rounded corners and clear contrast between active (Magenta) and inactive (Gray) states.

* **Typography:** Use *Inter* for all interface text, maintaining readability and consistency. *Montserrat Bold* may appear in small doses for titles or labels in hero sections.

* **Icons:** Line-style, minimal, and monoweight. Use magenta accents for active states or notifications.

* **Layout:** Prioritize simplicity and vertical flow. Keep consistent padding and align key actions above the fold.

* **Gamification & Feedback:** Use subtle animations and small bursts of magenta for confirmation states (e.g., likes, event joins, or token rewards).

The goal is an interface that feels **smooth, social, and immediate** — a space where users connect effortlessly, with the brand color reinforcing every action.

### **8\. Brand Materials & Applications**

CROWDIA’s brand materials translate its digital identity into physical and professional formats.  
 Every asset should preserve the brand’s clarity and energy — **minimal layout, bold magenta accents, and clean typography**.

**Core Materials:**

* **Pitch Deck Template:** White background with magenta accent lines or section headers. Use *Montserrat Bold* for titles and *Inter* for body text. Keep slides uncluttered and visually consistent.

* **Digital Business Card:** Logo or app icon on one side (magenta background), personal details in charcoal text on white or gray background on the other.

* **Email Signature:** Simple structure with the CROWDIA logo or icon in magenta. Include only essential contact info for a clean look.

* **Press Kit:** A digital folder including logo variations, color codes, font details, and a short brand description. Ensure all logos are provided in `.SVG`, `.PNG`, and `.PDF` formats.

* **Branded Merchandise (optional):** Use magenta as the dominant color on apparel, stickers, or promotional material, with white or charcoal for contrast.

Every application — digital or print — should instantly communicate **CROWDIA’s energy, simplicity, and confidence** through consistent use of its visual system.
