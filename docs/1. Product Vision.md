# **Product Vision**

### **1\. Vision & Mission**

Our mission is to transform the way people discover and experience events in their city. Starting with Palermo as the initial launch city, the app will act as a **social concierge**, guiding users to the best events, the most vibrant venues, and the most dynamic social experiences. Beyond event discovery, our vision is to encourage and organize social life more effectively, becoming a central hub for nightlife, entertainment, and networking.

### **2\. Target Users**

The app will include **dedicated sections** tailored to different user types:

* **Event Organizers**: to create, promote, and sell tickets directly.

* **Influencers / PRs**: to leverage their following, promote events, and earn rewards.

* **Consumers / Users**: to find events, interact socially, and enjoy personalized recommendations.

Specific user acquisition targets (e.g., number of active users and influencers) will be defined in the next phase.

### **3\. Value Proposition**

* **For consumers**: a one-stop platform to discover events, buy tickets instantly, and gamify their social life.

* **For organizers**: lower commissions than competing platforms, integrated marketing tools, and direct access to influencers.

* **For influencers**: visibility, monetization through tokens, and trust-building via verified memberships connected to their social accounts (Instagram, TikTok).

### **4\. Market Positioning & Differentiation**

We aim to position ourselves as the **go-to event discovery and social engagement platform**, with unique advantages over competitors:

* Native token integration for payments and rewards.

* Gamification mechanics that increase engagement and retention.

* Lower transaction fees for event organizers.

* City ambassador model for rapid and decentralized market expansion.

### **5\. Monetization Strategy**

Revenue will primarily come from:

* Ticket sales with competitive commission rates (lower than competitors).

* Premium memberships and subscriptions.

* Partnerships with influencers and event organizers.

* Strategic brand sponsorships in the nightlife and entertainment sectors.

### **6\. Key Features**

* Personalized event discovery feed.  
* Integrated ticketing system with instant token-to-fiat conversion (users wonâ€™t perceive the crypto step).  
* Influencer and organizer dashboards.  
* Membership badges and verified profiles.  
* Gamification through point systems and achievements.  
* AI concierge chatbot  
* Location always on like Google maps and Hinge  
* Heat map thanks to location data

### **7\. Token Economy & Gamification**

* **All transactions** will run on our **native token**, with seamless conversion to fiat for end-users.

* Influencers and PRs will be paid directly in tokens, with specific vesting/holding rules to be decided later.

* Users will earn points and token rewards based on interactions (sharing events, attending, reviewing, inviting friends).

### **8\. Influencer & PR Strategy**

* Dedicated app section for influencers/PRs.

* Membership system to showcase reliability and reach, linked to social accounts.

* Token-based incentive system for influencers promoting events.

* Specific influencer acquisition goals will be defined in the next phase.

### **9\. Ambassadors for City Expansion**

We will create an **ambassador role** (a "city colonizer") who, with our authorization, will push the app in a new city. These ambassadors will play a key role in replicating our model rapidly and effectively across multiple locations.

### **10\. Competitive Advantage**

Our competitive edge will be built on:

* **Lower fees** for event organizers compared to other platforms.

* **Higher engagement** through gamification and social interaction.

* **Crypto-native ecosystem** that remains simple and user-friendly.

* **Scalable growth model** through ambassadors and influencer partnerships.

### **11\. Future Ideas**

Ideas that we may build later:

* **Crowd funding** for event organizers to raise money for their event

* **Event Tokens** that are generated unique for each event that can be used as an investment AND speculation vehicle
